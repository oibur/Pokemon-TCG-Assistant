This program will:
-Create an excel sheet with the names of all Pokemon sets released
-Create an excel sheet with a list of all Pokemon cards released
-List up-to-date prices for all cards released
Import a csv of your collection in order to:
-Create an excel sheet of all doubles you have (to trade!)
-Create an excel sheet of all cards you're missing (ISO list!)
-Create an excel sheet of the value of your cards (individual and total)

My aim is to create an app that can help me keep track of all my Pokemon cards. 
1. What doubles do I have available to trade
    -Able to filter by set, reverse holo, rarity, etc. 
2. What is the value of my entire collection
3. What is the value of individual cards
4. What cards have changed a lot in value lately
    -Top 5 weekly drops and top 5 weekly jumps
5. What are the cheapest cards to buy that I don't have yet
I will start off by tackling each of these features individually, but hope to tie it all together into a single app with interactive menus.
