My write_missing script isn't working right because my_cards and prices.xlsx only contain cards I have. I need to create a master list that has all cards whether I have them or not and just update as I go. Then continue on with figuring out pricing and then probably make pivot tables with slices to sort cards better.

I have written scripts to: 1. write my doubles 2. write my missing 3. update a master excel in prices folder that will keep track of prices over time. I am still trying to figure out how to 
1. pull prices of unlimited AND reverse 
2. multiply price by column quantity AND add unlimited and reverse totals together if I have both formats so that 
3. One total price is added per row (under the column title being the date) even if there are multiple columns for that row to be calculated.
4. Continue with rest of requirements outlined below

My aim is to create an app that can help me keep track of all my Pokemon cards. 
# 1. What doubles do I have available to trade
    -Able to filter by set, reverse holo, rarity, etc. 
2. What is the value of my entire collection
3. What is the value of individual cards
4. What cards have changed a lot in value lately
    -Top 5 weekly drops and top 5 weekly jumps
5. What are the cheapest cards to buy that I don't have yet

I will start off by tackling each of these features individually, but hope to tie it all together into a single app with interactive menus.
